Utahraptor (meaning Utah's predator) is a genus of large dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived in North America during the Early Cretaceous period.

Given the huge size of Utahraptor, it was not fast as Deinonychus or Velociraptor, instead, it would have had a similar speed to the contemporary iguanodonts, and being faster than fellow sauropods. Additionally, the thickness of the tibia indicates that the animal had a significant leg force in order to kill preys.
