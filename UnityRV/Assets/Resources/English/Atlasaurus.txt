Atlasaurus imelakei is a genus of sauropod dinosaurs lived during the Middle Jurassic.

The Atlasaurus is one of the oldest giant sauropods. The size of the adults is enough to keep predators away and allow it to graze plants from the treetops. This dinosaur lives in small family groups and not in large flocks as the sauropods will grow much later.
