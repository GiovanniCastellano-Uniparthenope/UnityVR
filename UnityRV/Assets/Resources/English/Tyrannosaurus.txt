Tyrannosaurus (meaning Tyrant lizard king) is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived during the Cretaceous, about 68-66 million years ago.

The Tyrannosaurus mixed the size of an elephant, the violence of a tiger and the jaw strength of a shark. There are thoughts about the T-Rex being on top of the food chain, from what derives it's scientific name.
