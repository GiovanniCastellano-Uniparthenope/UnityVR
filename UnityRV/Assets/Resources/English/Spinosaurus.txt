Spinosaurus (meaning "spine lizard") is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived during the Cretaceous period, about 112 to 97 million years ago.

It is unclear whether Spinosaurus was primarily a terrestrial predator or a piscivore, as indicated by its elongated jaws, conical teeth and raised nostrils. They base this on the anatomical similarity with crocodilians and the presence of digestive acid-etched fish scales in the rib cage of the type specimen.
