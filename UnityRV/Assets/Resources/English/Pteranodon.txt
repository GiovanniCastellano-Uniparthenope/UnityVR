Pteranodon is a genus of pterosaur that included some of the largest known flying reptiles. They lived during the late Cretaceous about 86-84 million years ago.

The diet of Pteranodon is known to have included fish; fossilized fish bones have been found in the stomach area of one Pteranodon, though they may also have taken invertebrates and mollusks.
